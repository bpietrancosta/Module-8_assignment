## SQL analysis on crowdfunding campaigns

This file will only contain a very high level overview of the analysis. 

### 1) Backer count for campaigns. As we would expect there is a very unequal distribution of backers for each campaign. 

The campaign with the most backers has over 3600 the one with the least has less than 36.

### 2) The remaining amount required for campaigns to meet their objective is also very unequal. 

Per the above observation it stands to reason that campaigns with more backers also have higher amounts pledged + sought. Therefore, we also see this disparity here.

### In conclusion, the analysis confirms that crowdfunding campaigns are highly disparate.
